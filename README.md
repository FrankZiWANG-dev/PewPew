## Project
This is a game where the player uses directional keys to move an icon (hand sanitizer) to shoot at targets (viruses). After hitting 10 targets, the player wins.

## Technologies
The game relies on HTML canvas, animated using Javascript. The styling was added using CSS / SASS.

## Roadmap
After laying the basic structure of the page with HTML, the game itself was coded with Javascript. Additional styling was done after to make the page look less rough.
Functionalities such as a timer and other game features might be added later.

## Images
All images were edited (cropped, rotated) using Photos software on Windows 10.
